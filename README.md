Ad-hoc Name Parser
==================

This is a disposable app for a one-off task that reads in a list of names from a MySQL table where the was just one field to identify the name, e.g. "Bob Jones", and breaks the name out into separate fields (e.g. firstname, surname, gender, genderConfidence).

The name parsing component is done by [NameAPI](https://www.nameapi.org).
